									<h2 id="content">1 Data Science Project</h2>
										<p>I have developed solution to real-world problem by leveraging public dataset from Data Science . Following the CRISP-DM methodology, I have executed projects that use agile development cycles to generate data-driven insights. These insights have become the foundation for informed decision-making by business teams, leading to improved outcomes. In the process, I have honed my skills in data manipulation, data cleaning,  and machine learning, which have been applied in the creation and deployment of production-level algorithms using Cloud Computing tools. </br></br> Further details on these projects will be provided in the next section.</p>
										<h2 id="content">2 years with Data Analyst </h2>
										<p>In my previous roles, I gained valuable experience in data analysis within two distinct areas. As a payment analyst, I worked extensively with payment methods, transaction monitoring, and money laundering prevention, providing me with a solid understanding of financial data analysis. In my role as a data analyst in the supply chain, I created and managed KPI dashboards, providing insights into supply chain performance and identifying areas for improvement. My experience in both roles has allowed me to develop a strong analytical skillset, a deep understanding of data management, and the ability to drive business value through data-driven decision-making.</p>
										<h2 id="content">7 years with Business Analyst </h2>
										<p>Collaborating with stakeholders to identify and document business requirements.
Analyzing and evaluating business processes, data, and systems to identify areas for improvement.
Developing and documenting project plans and strategies.
Communicating with project teams and stakeholders to ensure project goals are met.
Conducting research and preparing reports to support business decisions.
Participating in testing and quality assurance activities to ensure the final product meets requirements.
Providing ongoing support and training to end-users.</p>
										<h2 id="content">3 years with Web Developer </h2>
										<p>I was involved in creating and upkeeping internal and commercial web systems, utilizing PHP, JS, HTML, CSS, and PL/SQL programming languages. Grew my ability to think logically and analytically, which was further improved by my involvement in the development of process and system manuals.</p>

													  <h3>Potential profits for each of Companny's stores over the next six weeks</h3>
													  <p>I developed a predictive sales algorithm for 1115 stores, which is available 24/7 via smartphone access. This model accurately predicts the potential profits for each of Companny's stores over the next six weeks and sends real-time information via API to the Telegram app. As part of this project, I also created a customized Telegram bot that accepts store codes, retrieves data from the API, and delivers sales forecasts instantly. This solution has enabled Companny to make data-driven decisions quickly and efficiently, resulting in improved sales and overall business outcomes.</p>

											<h3>Health Insurance Cross Sell</h3>
											<p>Challenged by a health insurance company to detect customers who are more likely to purchase second insurance, but this time, auto insurance. My mission is to calculate the propensity to buy each client in the base and return to the business team, a prioritized list, starting with the most likely client to the least likely.</p>
